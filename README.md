# experimental-study-pillowtype
In this research study, we aim to investigate the impact of different types of pillows on sleep quality, specifically comparing latex pillows to standard feather pillows. The research proposal outlines the problem statement, study objectives, and research design. We hypothesize that the mean sleep score for the latex pillow is significantly higher than that for the standard feather pillow. Additionally, we explore whether age plays a role in sleep quality, hypothesizing that the mean sleep score for the age group 21-40 is significantly lower than that for the age group 41-60. The study's importance lies in its potential to help organizations like Mattress Firm tailor their marketing campaigns to different pillow types and age groups, ultimately benefiting society by promoting better sleep quality. The research plan, statistical analysis, sample size considerations, and limitations are all detailed, providing a comprehensive framework for the study. We also simulate scenarios to understand the potential outcomes under different conditions, allowing us to anticipate results and implications.
